# Knowledge Base System Documentation

## Overview

The Knowledge Base system is a comprehensive solution for managing and displaying knowledge articles, FAQs, and documentation. It consists of:

1. **Database Schema**: A well-structured database design for storing articles, categories, tags, and related data
2. **Admin Interface**: A user-friendly interface for managing knowledge content
3. **Public-Facing Pages**: Customer-accessible pages for browsing and searching the knowledge base
4. **API Endpoints**: Backend services for data retrieval and management

This system serves as both a customer-facing FAQ module and the foundation for the AI assistant that will be implemented in the future.

## Database Schema

The knowledge base uses the following database tables:

### Main Tables

- **knowledge_categories**: Organizes articles into hierarchical categories
- **knowledge_articles**: Stores the actual knowledge content
- **knowledge_tags**: Provides additional classification through tagging
- **knowledge_article_tags**: Links articles to tags (many-to-many relationship)

### Supporting Tables

- **knowledge_article_feedback**: Tracks user feedback on articles
- **knowledge_article_views**: Records article view statistics
- **knowledge_article_revisions**: Maintains article version history
- **knowledge_related_articles**: Links related articles together

### Key Features

- **Automatic Slug Generation**: URLs are automatically generated from titles
- **Hierarchical Categories**: Categories can have parent-child relationships

## API Endpoints

The knowledge base is powered by the following API endpoints:

### Articles

- `GET /api/knowledge/articles`: List articles with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/knowledge/articles`: Create a new article
- `GET /api/knowledge/article/[slug]`: Get a specific article by slug
- `PUT /api/knowledge/article/[slug]`: Update an article
- `DELETE /api/knowledge/article/[slug]`: Delete an article

### Categories

- `GET /api/knowledge/categories`: List categories with optional filtering
- `POST /api/knowledge/categories`: Create a new category

### Tags

- `GET /api/knowledge/tags`: List all tags with usage statistics
- `POST /api/knowledge/tags`: Create a new tag

### Search

- `GET /api/knowledge/search`: Search articles, categories, and tags

## Security

The knowledge base implements several security measures:

- **Row-Level Security**: Database policies control access to content
- **Admin-Only Editing**: Only admin users can create/edit content
- **Draft Articles**: Unpublished articles are only visible to admins
- **Authentication**: API endpoints verify user permissions

## Integration with AI Assistant

The knowledge base is designed to serve as the foundation for the AI assistant:

1. **Knowledge Source**: Articles provide the knowledge base for the AI
2. **Structured Data**: Well-organized content improves AI responses
3. **Feedback Loop**: User feedback helps improve both content and AI responses
4. **Search Analytics**: Common searches inform AI training and content creation

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Article

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to the Knowledge Base section in the admin panel
3. Click "New Article"
4. Fill in the title, content, and other fields
5. Select a category and add relevant tags
6. Choose whether to publish immediately or save as draft
7. Click "Save"

### Browsing the Knowledge Base

1. Visit the Knowledge Base homepage
2. Browse categories or use the search function
3. Click on an article to view its content
4. Use related articles and tags to explore related topics

## Testing

A comprehensive test script is provided in `test-knowledge-base.js` that validates:

- Category management functionality
- Tag management functionality
- Article CRUD operations
- Search functionality

Run the test script with:

```bash
node test-knowledge-base.js
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the knowledge base include:

1. **Rich Media Support**: Add support for images, videos, and other media
2. **User Contributions**: Allow trusted users to suggest edits or new articles
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed usage statistics and reporting
4. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
5. **AI-Assisted Content Creation**: Use AI to suggest improvements to articles

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Base system provides a robust foundation for managing and sharing information with customers. Its integration with the future AI assistant will create a powerful self-service support system that improves customer satisfaction while reducing support costs.
