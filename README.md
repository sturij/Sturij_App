# Sturij Calendar System - Clean Next.js Implementation

This is a clean Next.js implementation of the Sturij Calendar System that resolves the Deno-related build errors you were experiencing. This solution uses Next.js API routes for email functionality instead of Supabase Edge Functions, making it fully compatible with Vercel deployment.

## What Caused the Build Errors

Your build was failing with errors like:
```
Failed to compile due to TypeScript errors in supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts
Cannot find module 'https://deno.land/std@0.131.0/http/server.ts' from TypeScript compilation
Mixing Deno modules with Next.js environment
```

This happened because:
1. Your project contained Supabase Edge Functions (in the `supabase/functions/send-email` directory)
2. These functions used Deno-specific imports that aren't compatible with Next.js
3. Next.js tried to compile these files during the build process and failed

## How This Solution Fixes the Problem

This clean implementation:
1. Completely removes all Supabase Edge Functions with Deno imports
2. Uses Next.js API routes for email functionality instead
3. Adds configuration to exclude any Supabase functions directories from compilation
4. Provides the same functionality without any Deno dependencies

## Deployment Instructions for Vercel

### 1. Prepare Your Project

Before deploying to Vercel, make sure:
- You've completely removed any `supabase/functions` directory from your project
- You have the `jsconfig.json` file that excludes the `supabase/functions` directory
- Your `next.config.js` is properly configured

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables in Vercel

In your Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Your SendGrid API key
- `EMAIL_SENDER`: contact@sturij.com
- `TEST_EMAIL_RECIPIENT`: mark.walton@gmail.com
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import the repository in Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project
4. Click "Deploy"

### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment:
1. Check the build logs to ensure there are no Deno-related errors
2. Visit the `/test-email` route to test the email functionality
3. Verify that all components are working correctly

## If You Still Encounter Build Errors

If you still see Deno-related errors after deploying this clean implementation:

1. **Check for Hidden Files**: Make sure there are no hidden Supabase Edge Function files in your repository
2. **Create a .vercelignore File**: Add a `.vercelignore` file to your project root with:
   ```
   supabase/functions
   ```
3. **Update .gitignore**: Add the following to your `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   # Supabase
   supabase/functions
   ```
4. **Force Clean Deployment**: In Vercel, try deploying with the "Override" option to force a clean build

## Email Functionality

This implementation uses Next.js API routes for email functionality:

- `pages/api/send-email.js`: API route that handles sending emails via SendGrid
- `lib/emailService.js`: Client-side service for email functionality

To test the email functionality, visit the `/test-email` route in your deployed application.
